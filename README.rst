fmupy
=====

This is the "fmupy" library which aims to create an easy-to-use python framework
for the integration of fmu simulations.

for more information of FMI have a look here:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Mock-up_Interface
* https://www.fmi-standard.org/

The library aims to include as few 3rd-party-dependencys as possible to make it easy
to set-up

nevertheless some examples are included how to integrate FMU models
with matplotlib, numpy and 3rd-party solvers.
